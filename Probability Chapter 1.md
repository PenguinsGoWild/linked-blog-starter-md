**The basic principle of counting:**
If there are two experiments which each have separate individual possible outcomes **m** and **n**, there the total possible outcomes of the two outcomes is **mn**.

**The generalised basic principle of counting**:
If r experiments are performed such that the first experiment may result in any of $n_1$ possible outcomes; and if, for each of these $n_1$ possible outcomes, there are $n_2$ possible outcomes  of the second experiment; and if, for each of the possible outcomes of the first two experiments, there are $n_3$ possible outcomes of the third experiment, then the total number of possible outcomes of the r experiments is the product of all the $n_i$ where $i=1,2,\dots,r$ i.e. $n_1\times n_2 \times \dots n_r$ 

*Suppose now that we have n objects. By the basic principle of counting:*
The possible permutations of n objects is given by: $$n(n-1)(n-1)\cdots3\cdot2\cdot1=n!$$
*To find a combination of r objects from n total objects,*
We define $\large\binom nr$, for $r\leq n$ by $$\binom nr = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!\;r!}$$
and say that $\large\binom n r$ (read as "n choose r") represents the number of possible combinations of n objects taken r at a time.
Equivalently, $\large\binom nr$ is the number of  subsets of size r that can be chosen from a set of size n. 
Note that $$0! = 1$$
and that
$$\binom nr = \binom n0 = \frac{n!}{0!n!} = 1$$
