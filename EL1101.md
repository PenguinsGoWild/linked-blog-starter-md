*Linguistics is the scientific study of language as a system and as a social phenomenon*

**Grammar**
This refers to the systematic patterns that constitute any particular language variety.


Linguistics involves a wide range of quantitative and qualitative research methods and tools.
- Brain imaging
- Acoustic analysis software
- Statistical analysis of corpora
- Ethnographic fieldwork

When we say that we know a language, what exactly do we mean that we know?
- Two common types of answers:
	- Function: knowing how to communicate / express yourself
	- Form: knowing the words of that language and the rules for putting them together.

*The study of the structure of words and their parts is called morphology.*
*The study of language and meaning is called semantics.*
*The study of how context contributes to linguistics meaning is called pragmatics.*

Some design features of communications systems proposed by linguist Charles Hockett (1960):
- Whilst some of these features are shared by animal communication systems, Hockett proposed that human language is unique in having all of them.

### Feature 1: Arbitrariness
Is there any inherent connection between the word 'dog' and a dog?
**Nope!**
*What about onomatopoeia? This is an exception! For the most part, words don't have any inherent connection.*

### Feature 2: Discreteness
All languages are made up of discrete units at various levels of structure:

| Phones    | slaÉªdz                   |
| --------- | ------------------------ |
| Morphemes | slides-s                 |
| Words     | slides                   |
| Phrases   | these slides             |
| Sentences | these slides are amazing |


### Feature 3: Rule governedness
The discrete units of language combine in **rule-governed** ways - all languages have grammatical patterns.

For example:
- "**I am** taller than him" -> "**I'm** taller than him"
- "He is taller than **I am**" -> \*"He is taller than I'm"  (*This is wrong*)


### Features 4: Productivity
We can use the finite grammar of a language to compose an infinite number of utterances.
e.g. "Dr. Starr then astonished the class by producing a sentence that had never before existed in the history of the universe."


## Two major approaches to studying language
- We can take a snapshot of a language, frozen in time, and study its structure at various levels. (**synchronic**)
- Or, we can study how features of a language change over time. (**diachronic**)

Finding out how languages were historically related to each other is called historical linguistics.

Synchronic linguistics is sometimes called formal linguistics
