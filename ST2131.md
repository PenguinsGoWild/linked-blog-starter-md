**The basic principle of counting:**
If there are two experiments which each have separate individual possible outcomes **m** and **n**, there the total possible outcomes of the two outcomes is **mn**.

**The generalised basic principle of counting**:
If r experiments are performed such that the first experiment may result in any of $n_1$ possible outcomes; and if, for each of these $n_1$ possible outcomes, there are $n_2$ possible outcomes  of the second experiment; and if, for each of the possible outcomes of the first two experiments, there are $n_3$ possible outcomes of the third experiment, then the total number of possible outcomes of the r experiments is the product of all the $n_i$ where $i=1,2,\dots,r$ i.e. $n_1\times n_2 \times \dots n_r$ 

*Suppose now that we have n objects. By the basic principle of counting:*
The possible permutations of n objects is given by: $$n(n-1)(n-1)\cdots3\cdot2\cdot1=n!$$
*To find a combination of r objects from n total objects,*
We define $\large\binom nr$, for $r\leq n$ by $$\binom nr = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!\;r!}$$
and say that $\large\binom n r$ (read as "n choose r") represents the number of possible combinations of n objects taken r at a time.
Equivalently, $\large\binom nr$ is the number of  subsets of size r that can be chosen from a set of size n. 
Note that $$0! = 1$$
and that
$$\binom nr = \binom n0 = \frac{n!}{0!n!} = 1$$

When a set of n distinct items is to be divided into r distinct groups of respective sizes, $n_1, n_2,\cdots ,n_r$, where the sum of the respective sizes equal n, the possible number of divisions possible is given by:

One way to determine the number of possible outcomes for the initial round is to first determine the number of possible pairings for that round. 
1st: The number of ways of dividing 8 people into 4 pairs is given by:
![[Pasted image 20250121175816.png]]
2nd: Then there is no ordering of the 4 pairs. Thus it turns into
![[Pasted image 20250121180049.png]]
3rd: For each pairing, there are 2 possible choice per pair for a winner, thus it turns into:
![[Pasted image 20250121180210.png]]
hence it is: $$\frac {8!}{4!}$$

an alternative way is

1st: There are $\binom {8}{4}$ possible choices of the 4 winners
2nd: For each choice, there are $4!$ ways to pair the 4 winners with the 4 losers. Thus there are $4!\binom{8}{4} = \frac{8!}{4!}$


Similarly, for each result of round 1, there are $\frac{4!}{2!}$ possible outcomes of round 2, and for each of the outcomes of the first two rounds, there are $\frac{2!}{1!}$ possible outcomes of round 3. 
By generalized basic principle of counting, there are: $$\frac{8!}{4!} \frac{4!}{2!} \frac{2!}{1!} = 8!$$
possible outcomes
thus a knockout tournament of $n=2^m$ players has $n!$ possible outcomes

To find the possible number of combinations $x_r$ of the equation $x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_r = n$ we can imagine that we have $n$ number of zeroes lined up consecutively in a row. 
$$0\;0\;0\dots\;0\;0$$
The solution to the possible number of combinations $C$ is equal to the number of possible combinations of $r-1$ choices out of $n-1$ spaces (between the zeroes). Like so:
$$0\wedge0\wedge0\wedge \cdots\wedge0\wedge0$$
One particular solution may be represented like:
$$0.0000.000$$
which represents $n-1=7$ spaces and $r-1=2$ possible number of combinations, leading to $C=21$ with this particular solution being $x_1 =1,\;x_2=4,\;x_3=3$
