When giving lines, planes or points, specify what they intersect. e.g.
	**Give a geometrical interpretation for the linear equation** $$ x + y + z = 1$$
	It is a plane that passes through the points $(0,0,1), (0,1,0) \textnormal{ and } (1,0,0)$ respectively.
	**Give a geometrical interpretation for the linear equation** $$ x - y = 0 $$
	_In the xy-plane_: It represents a line that passes through $(s,s)$ for any $s\in \R$.
	_In the xyz-plane_: It represents a plane containing the z-axis that intersects the xy-plane at the line $x=s,y=s,z=0$ where $s\in\R$.
	**Give a geometrical interpretation for the solutions to the system of linear equations** $$\Huge\left\{ \substack{
	x&+&y&+&z&=&1\\x&-&y&&&=&0
	}\right.$$
	It is the line of intersection of the two planes $x+y+z=1$ and $x-y=0$

	7. (a) Either the three lines are parallel but not all three are the same or two of  
	the lines intersect at a point but this point does not lie on the third line.  
	(b) All three lines are distinct and intersect at a single point, or two of the  
	lines are identical and they intersect the third line at a point.  
	(c) All three lines are identical.

	8. (a) Either the three planes are parallel but not all three are the same or two  
	of the planes intersect at a line but this line is parallel to and does not lie  
	on the third plane.  
	(b) Two of the planes intersect at a line and this line is not parallel to the  
	third plane (i.e. the three planes intersect at a single point).  
	(c) Either two of the planes intersect at a line and this line lies on the third  
	plane (i.e. the three planes intersect at a common line) or all three planes  
	are identical.
