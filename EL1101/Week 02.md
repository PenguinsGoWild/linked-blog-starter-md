**Approaches to phonetics**
*Phonetics: the study of speech sounds.*
As we saw in the chain, there are cognitive, physiological, and acoustic aspects of the production and perception of speech.
- This means a lot to study, requiring many different types of research tools.

Three main areas of phonetics:
- Articulatory phonetics: the study of how speech sounds are produced.
- Acoustic phonetics: the study of the acoustic properties of the speech signal.
- Auditory phonetics: the study of listeners' perception of speech sounds.

Process of speech production
- The voice is powered by air coming up from the lungs.
- The human voice, including speech, is create by the way that air is molded by different parts of the vocal tract as it travels up to escape through our mouth and nose

**Larynx:**
- Commonly called voice box / Adam's apple.
- Vocal folds can be manipulated into various configurations.
- In certain configurations, air passing through causes the folds to vibrate, producing sound.

## Consonants vs. Vowels
- Consonants: airflow through the oral cavity is obstructed in some way.
- Vowels: airflow through the oral cavity is not obstructed.


## Three key features capture consonants
1) Voicing (voiced vs. voiceless)
2) Place of articulation
	- Where is the air flow obstructed?
3) Manner of articulation
	- How is the air flow obstructed?
	- Includes nasality (oral vs. nasal)


### Place of articulation: articulators
- Obstructions are created using articulators (almost all in the oral cavity)
- We can usually identify an active articulator and a passive articulator.
	- For example, the tongue often moves up to contact part of the roof of the mouth.

| Location            | Place of articulation |
| ------------------- | --------------------- |
| lips                | labial                |
| teeth               | dental                |
| alveolar ridge      | alveolar              |
| hard palate         | palatal               |
| soft palate (velum) | velar                 |
| glottis             | glottal               |

### Bilabial
*between thine lips*

Oral
- PET (voiceless)
- BET (voiced)
- WET (voiced)

Nasal:
- MET (voiced)

### Labiodental
*between thine lips and teeth*

FINE (voiceless)
VINE (voiced)

### Interdental
*between thine teeth*
**TH**IN (voiceless) **\[ θ \]**
**TH**IS (voiced) **\[ ð \]**

Different people have different ways of making these sounds!
- Some put their tongue between their teeth (interdental)
- Others put their tongue behind their teeth (dental)
*For this course, we'll just call them interdental*

### Alveolar
Oral:
- **T**UNE
- **D**UNE
- **S**OON
- **Z**OO
- **L**OON
- **R**UNE *(note: the reading for this week classifies this sound as 'retroflex' instead of alveolar, but for this course we will consider it alveolar.)* 

Nasal:
- **N**OON

### Post-alveolar
**SH**IP: **\[ ʃ \]**
**G**ENRE / MEA**S**URE: **\[ ʒ \]**
**CH**IP: **\[ tʃ \]**
**G**YM: **\[ ʤ \]**

### Palatal
**Y**ES: **\[ j \]**

### Velar
Oral:
- **K**IT (voiceless)
- **G**IFT (voiced)

Nasal:
- KI**NG**, THI**N**K **\[ ŋ \]** ("engma")

*In English, engmas never appear at the beginning of a word or syllable. But they do in other languages like Cantonese.*

### Uvular?
We don't have any uvular sounds in English.
But they are fun:
- **\[ R \]** Can you guess what sound this is?

### Glottal
Produced by narrowing or closing vocal folds.

**H**AT
UH-OH: **\[ ʔ \]** ("glottal stop")
*(NOTE: We often produce words that begin with vowels with an initial glottal stop (e.g., "apple"). However, this initial glottal stop is not considered part of the 'basic' pronunciation of the word, because it only appears in certain contexts. So, the first consonant in "apple" would be [p], not [ʔ].)*

# Manner of articulation
### Stops
In a stop, the oral cavity is completely blocked.
There are two types of stop:
- Oral stop (aka **plosive**):
	- \[p\], \[b\], \[t\], \[d\], \[k\], \[g\], \[ʔ\]
	- Good test for plosive: can you hold out the sound?

- Nasal stop:
	- \[m\], \[n\], \[ŋ\]

### Fricatives and Affricates
- **Fricative**: partial obstruction, causing turbulence  (a "buzzy" noise).
	- \[f\], \[t\], \[θ\], \[ð\], \[s\], \[z\], \[ʃ\], \[ʒ\], \[h\]
- **Affricate**: a stop plus a fricative.
	- \[tʃ\], \[ʤ\]

### Approximants: Liquids and Glides
Liquids:
- Constriction but no turbulence
- \[l\]: lateral liquid
- \[r\]: central liquid

Glides:
- Also called "semi-vowels." Very vowely.
- \[j\], \[w\]

### Distinctive features
Maximum info we need to identify any consonant:
- Voicing
- Place
- Manner
	- Reminder: includes nasality
	- For liquids, we need lateral / central.
- Certain consonants of English are identifiable with less info (e.g., \[j]).

### How do we transcribe using IPA?
We write IPA within square brackets to indicate a phonetic transcription.
Depending how precise we want to be, we can use a more **narrow** (detailed) or **broad** transcription.
![[Pasted image 20250202153331.png]]
For this module, we will focus on broad transcription.
To type in IPA, this tool is recommended:

## Why am I finding some consonants difficult to distinguish?
**Final consonant devoicing**: in Singapore, many speakers pronounce voiced consonants at the ends of words as voiceless.
- Do 'peace' and 'peas' sound the same to you?

**th/dh stopping**: in Singapore, many speakers pronounce \[θ] as \[t] and \[ð] as \[d].
- Do 'thin' and 'tin' sound the same to you?
